## Gameplay

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where you control a bird with the objective to navigate through a series of pipes. The bird flaps when you tap the screen (or press the spacebar) to keep it afloat. The game gets progressively harder as you score more points, with pipes becoming closer together and the bird's speed increasing.

## Installation

To play Flappy Bird, you don't need any installation or setup. Simply visit our game website and start playing!

## How to Play

1. Click the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Control the bird by tapping the screen (or pressing the spacebar).
3. Keep the bird afloat by tapping or clicking.
4. Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
5. Try to score as many points as possible by passing through the pipes.
6. Don't let the bird fall to the ground or touch the pipes; doing so ends the game.

## Scoring

- Each pipe passed through successfully earns you one point.
- Your high score is recorded on the screen.
- Compete with friends and aim for the highest score!
